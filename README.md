# Competitive Programming

### Description about this repo

This repository contains codes and tricks for implementing questions available on:

- Google Code Jam: https://code.google.com/codejam/
- Codechef: https://www.codechef.com/
- Hackerrank: https://www.hackerrank.com/
- ProjectEuler: http://projecteuler.net/

some other sites may exists, those will be added later on. 

### About the Code

The code will be written in **C++** (preffered) else **Java** (for BigInteger mostly).

A predecessor template will be uploaded for C++, which will have many code built into it.

### About the Book

The book is named **Introduction to Algorithm - 2nd Edition**, writted by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leicerson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein.

It explains the fundamental and advanced concepts for creating and building optimized algorithms. 

It would be a great help if people can go through this book before solving any problem.

### Implementation - Topic

This section covers the implementation and description about core topics linking to problem solving in competitive programming.
